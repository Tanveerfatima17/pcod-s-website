    <li><b >Why periods are irregular?</b></li>
        The term irregular period consists of both early and delay of menstrual cycle.Also their is difference between irregularities of menstrual 
        cycle of young women and women.<br>In young women whose period is just started or started between one to three years ago the irregularity is either 
        too close (duration of approx. 21 days between two periods) or too far(duration of approx. 45 days between two periods).Whereas in case of adult 
        women whose period had been started more than three years, the irregularity is either to close (duration of approx. 21 days between two periods) 
        or too far(duration of approx. 35 days between two periods).<br>The reasons for "why periods are irregular" could be many. 
        Few reaons are mentioned below, though these reasons may seem common or not harmful but they may affect menstrual cycle.<br> 
        <br>
        1]<b><u>Sleep Cycle</u>:</b><br> 
        Having an unhealthy sleep cycle and poor sleep quality leads to increase in cortisol hormone (which plays an important role in stress response) and this leads to 
        decrease of leptin hormone (which is released for balancing energy level in body), such condition leads to the delay of ovulation period and hence irregularity in 
        menstrual cycle occurs.<br>
        <br>
        2]<b><u>Stress</u>:</b><br>
        As mentioned in sleep cycle point cortisol hormone is at its peak level when we are stressed whereas its level should be more in early
        morning and less in night or midnight. So this hormone disturbs the balance of progesterone-estrogen hormones which leads to irregular 
        periods.<br>  
        <br>
        3]<b><u>Medicines</u>:</b><br> 
        In many young women, the continue or over-use of birth control pills also highly affects irregularity and disturbs the hormonal harmony of 
        body.<br>
        <br>
        4]<b><u>Weight changes</u>:</b><br>

        The pancreas are responsible for production of insulin. When we eat food our body breaks down it in form of glucose which produces energy to our body
        Through blood, insulin is mixed with glucose and it allows cells in muscles, fat and liver to absorb and also stores energy for later use. For 
        several reasons, body can not respond properly to insulin efficiently which is called as insulin resistance. If your pancreas 
        makes more insulin to overcome increasing blood glucose level, is called as hyperinslinemia.<br>
        According to reserch, it is found that about 65-70% of women with PCOS have insulin resistance and it have independent relationship with PCOS also it is not
        wholly cost by obesity. As common PCOS includes symptoms like heavy bleading, irregular period, painfull cramps, acne, facial hair growth, weight gain and 
        many more but high level insulin makes these symptoms more worse than they are. Women with insulin resistance are also having higher risk for developing chronic 
        condotions such as diabetes, obesity and hypertension.<br>
        For managing this issue diet and Exercise helps a lot. Daily exercise for 30 min can help to regulate blood glucose in body. Also having a healthy diet 
        which includes eating regularly throughout a day (eating every few hours) which keeps blood glucose level in stable whereas fasting or eating calorie restriction
        food may produce insulin resistance.<br>
